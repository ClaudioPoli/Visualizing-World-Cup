The project was divided into three main phases:
- Definition of task
  - Analysis and understanding of phenomena related to the competition, the players and teams they have taken part in the tournament.
- Pre processing
  - Preliminary phase useful for modeling the data according to the implementation needs. In this step Tableau Prep Builder, Excel and a DBMS (PostgreSQL) were  used.
- Analysis and implementation
  -  Choice of the best visual solutions useful for carrying out the tasks initially defined and implementation of the same through the use of the Flourish and Tableau tools. The developed dashboards include column chart, bar chart race, maps, sankey chart, butterfly chart, connected dot plot, scatter plot e line chart race.
